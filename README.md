# botzival
A Discord bot for my server.

Mostly for fun, thought it might be a fun programming challenge.

Music commands are disabled because I have to debug them lol.

Command list
  uptime - displays the time the bot has been online
  banm - shows a meme ban message
  joke - tells a joke
  ping - mentions a user 10 times over 10 seconds
  idt - fake identity theft command that uses randomly generated numbers
  help - displays command list
  musichelp - displays music command list
  modhelp - displays a list of mod-only commands
  mx - DMs a user the lines from the Matrix
  purge - mod only, deletes a specified number of messages
  delete - mod only, alias for purge
  ban - mod only, bans a user
  unban - mod only, unbans a user
  warn - mod only, warns a user
  src# - prints "speedruncomsharp sucks"

To-do list
1) Debug music commands and add to README
2) Learn to add SRC# as a dependency and add command support
